									<p>This report was prepared for the Fundamentals of Accounting and Finance course as 
										 part of a business certificate program during my undergraduate education. The course 
										 presents an introduction to topics in accounting and corporate finance. For the accounting
										 segment students are required to read and analyze financial statements
										 including income statements, balance sheets and statements of cash flows.
										 The finance part introduces how to value investment opportunities and make
										 financial projections. As a part of this course, students are required to write 
										 two reports during each part of the course. One of the two reports is presented below.
									    </p>
									<p>The paper required analysis, calculations and interpretations of Intel’s 2018 financial
										 statements. Preparation of the paper was done as a team of three students. The report 
										 mainly focuses on commenting on Intel’s liquidity, solvency and profitability metrics 
										 in order to determine the health of the company. To do this Intel’s performance was 
										 compared between 2017 and 2018 as well as compared to AMD, an industry competitor. 
										 Many metrics were sorted out from numerous financial statements and necessary 
										 calculations were done in the appendices to support all claims.
										</p>
									<p>This assignment has allowed me to gain an important skill of being about to evaluate 
										a company’s performance. Financial literacy is important in the engineering field as 
										it helps with understanding project and company decision making in the workplace. 
										Being able to use the provided data and performing calculations to produce meaningful 
										numbers for comparison is another engineering skill exemplified in this report. In 
										addition, working in yet another team environment provided an essential experience 
										for future work in the engineering field.
